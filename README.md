[00:02.81] Last night, all I think about is you
[00:06.28] Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
[00:08.82] Don't wanna, but I think about you
[00:11.84] You know that I'm never gonna lose
[00:28.84] 
[00:29.83] Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
[00:46.33] 
[00:32.48] Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
[00:35.55] Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
[00:38.40] Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
[00:56.40] 
[00:41.84] Sometimes all I think about is you
[00:44.79] Late nights in the middle of June
[00:47.27] Heat waves been faking me out
[00:51.08] Can't make you happier now
[01:04.08] 
[00:53.98] Sometimes all I think about is you
[00:56.90] Late nights in the middle of June
[00:59.64] Heat waves been faking me out
[01:02.57] Can't make you happier now
[01:15.57] 
[01:05.87] Usually, I put something on TV
[01:08.86] So we never think about you and me
[01:11.72] But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
[01:15.65] Laying on the screen
[01:25.65] 
[01:17.62] You just need a better life than this
[01:20.18] You need something I can never give
[01:23.21] Fake water all across the road
[01:25.75] It's gone now, the night has come, but
[01:44.75] 
[01:29.28] Sometimes all I think about is you
[01:31.84] Late nights in the middle of June
[01:34.79] Heat waves been faking me out
[01:37.85] Can't make you happier now
[01:50.85] 
[01:41.17] You can't fight it, you can't breathe
[01:43.42] You say something so loving, but
[01:46.68] Now I gotta let you go
[01:49.68] You'll be better off with someone new
[02:08.18] 
[01:52.49] I don't wanna be alone
[01:55.41] You know it hurts me too
[01:58.50] You look so broken when you cry
[02:01.53] One more and then I say goodbye
[02:17.03] 
[02:04.39] Sometimes all I think about is you
[02:07.66] Late nights in the middle of June
[02:10.82] Heat waves been faking me out
[02:13.53] Can't make you happier now
[02:26.53] 
[02:16.26] Sometimes all I think about is you
[02:20.01] Late nights in the middle of June
[02:22.81] Heat waves been faking me out
[02:26.05] Can't make you happier now
[02:39.05] 
[02:28.81] I just wonder what you're dreaming of
[02:31.84] When you sleep and smile so comfortable
[02:34.83] I just wish that I could give you that
[02:37.47] That look that's perfectly un-sad
[02:53.97] 
[02:39.92] Sometimes all I think about is you
[02:43.83] Late nights in the middle of June
[02:46.52] Heat waves been faking me out
[02:49.13] Heat waves been faking me out
[03:03.63] 
[02:56.51] Sometimes all I think about is you
[02:58.44] Late nights in the middle of June
[03:01.28] Heat waves been faking me out
[03:04.10] Can't make you happier now
[03:17.10] 
[03:07.09] Sometimes all I think about is you
[03:10.19] Late nights in the middle of June
[03:13.15] Heat waves been faking me out
[03:16.25] Can't make you happier now
[03:29.25] 
[03:20.19] Road shimmer wiggling the vision
[03:22.84] Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
[03:25.41] Road shimmer wiggling the vision
[03:27.90] Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
